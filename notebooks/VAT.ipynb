    "## PURPOSE\n",
    "Variant Association Tools [VAT, Wang et al (2014)] [1] was developed to perform quality control and association analysis of sequence data. It can also be used to analyze genotype data, e.g. exome chip data and imputed data. The software incorporates many rare variant association methods which include but not limited to Combined Multivariate Collapsing (CMC) [2], Burden of Rare Variants (BRV) [3], Weighted Sum Statistic (WSS) [4], Kernel Based Adaptive Cluster (KBAC) [5], Variable Threshold (VT) [6] and Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT) [7].\n",
    "VAT inherits the intuitive command-line interface of Variant Tools (VTools) [8] with re-design and implementation of its infrastructure to accommodate the scale of dataset generated from current sequencing efforts on large populations. Features of VAT are implemented into VTools subcommand system."
