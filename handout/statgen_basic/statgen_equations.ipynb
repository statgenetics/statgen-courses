    "\n",
    "#### No non-genetic effects\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the inclusion of fixed effects, which is omitted here for simplicity, the model doesn't account for environmental effects. Specifically, the equation $Var[\\textbf{y}] = \\sigma^2_g \\textbf{A} + \\sigma^2_e \\textbf{I}_N$ states that the phenotypic similarity among individuals is partly due to genetic factors, and that the GRM tells us who should be similar to whom, and partly due to other factors, which are unique for each individual, and independent of their genetic relatedness. This assumption would not be justified when working with close relatives - close relatives share environments as well as genes. It is less problematic in unrelated individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### No dominance effects\n",
    "\n",
    "Another assumption of our model is that for each SNP the effect of having two copies of the alternative allele is twice that of having on copy. In other words, we assume complete additivity and no dominance effects. This is not as bad as it sounds because the dominance effect is only whatever is left after removing the additive effect, and empirical data suggests that this is usually not a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### No epistasis\n",
    "\n",
    "Dominance can be seen as interaction effects of a SNP with itself, and epistasis describes interaction effects among different SNPs. For example if there is a SNP which leads to a gene knockout, the effect of another SNP which can lead to a knockout of the same gene will depend on the first SNP. It seems at first that these effects should be ubiquitous, but as with dominance effects, empirical evidence does not suggest that all epistatic effect together explain as much variance as the additive effects alone, partially because the interaction effects are again only what is left after accounting for additive effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's very useful, because the number of interactions among SNPs can grow very rapidly, which makes it hard to test them exhaustively. With $M$ SNPs, there are $\\frac{M(M-1)}{2}$ pairwise interactions, and pairwise interactions are only the simplest kind."

    "So what's the difference between the marginal single SNP GWAS model and the conditional multiple SNP OLS model? Imagine two SNPs with large, opposite effect size are in high LD. To the first model, this LD information is inaccessible, and because it can't control for the effect of the other SNP, it will calculate for each SNP an estimate of the combined effect of all the SNPs on the same haplotype block. In this case it means that the effects of both SNP cancel each other out and the GWAS estimate will be very small.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conditional OLS estimate on the other hand will be able to differentiate between the effects of both SNP, given $N$ is large enough (unless the LD correlation is one). This property of multiple regression can lead to more accurate estimates of the true effects. In our genotype model, all SNPs are independent, so there is not a large difference between conditional and marginal effects. However, the small chance correlation between SNPs that arises through the sampling process is enough to make conditional effect estimates different from marginal effect estimates. On the other hand, conditional effect estimates may not always be what is desired. Let's assume that a haplotype block with many highly correlated SNPs contains only one SNP with a true, large effect. In a the marginal GWAS model, all correlated SNPs will pick up the signal from this one SNP. In the conditional OLS model, the effect may get smeared out over all correlated SNPs, if $N$ is not large enough to assign the effect to only the causal SNP. By smearing out the effect, none of the SNPs may be found to be significantly associated.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a computational difference between the two models: The multiple regression model is slower because the inversion of $\\textbf{X}^\\top\\textbf{X}$ can take time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem with this model is that it is prone to overfitting the data, as $\\frac{M}{N}$ increases. This will lead to less accurate estimates of the true effect size. When $M > N$, it becomes impossible to apply this model, because $\\textbf{X}^\\top\\textbf{X}$ will become singular. This problem is being addressed by the BLUP model.\n",

The slope along the dimensions x1 and x2 represents $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_2$. Here, N is large relative to M (2). If that were not the case, the OLS model could easily overfit the data. To prevent that, BLUP softens the objective of minimizing the squared residuals (green segments), by modeling the y-values not as fixed values, but as measurements with a normally distributed error. The BLUP objective function is then to minimize the sum of squared residuals, while at the same time limiting the estimated beta values (preventing the surface from becoming too steep). The purple lines are the marginal effects for the two SNPs. On the left, they are just GWAS effects and on the right, they are shrunk marginal effects.

    "### Fixed effects vs random effects\n",
    "\n",
    "By now the terms fixed effects and random effects have been mentioned a few times without having been defined. If you, as I have, looked online what the definition of fixed and random effects is, chances are you are a bit confused at this point. There are many different definitons of these terms that have little in common with one another. One thing that everyone can agree on is that a mixed effects model gets its name from having both fixed and random effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how the terms fixed and random effects are used in the present context: SNP effects are modeled as random effects, everything else (age, sex, a couple of principal components, cohort) is modeled as a fixed effects (here, we don't have any fixed effects for simplicity). In concrete terms that means that in a mixed effects model OLS or [GLS (generalized least squares)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_least_squares) is used to estimate fixed effects (without shrinkage) and BLUP is used to estimate random effects (with shrinkage). Both can be estimated simultaneously in a mixed effects model to account for the covariance between fixed and random effects (see Henderson's mixed model equation). Usually the fixed effects are much smaller in number than the random effect (SNPs). That means that there is a practical reason for modelling SNPs as random: With $M > N$ it is impossible to estimate the effect of each SNP without shrinkage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you will also hear that random effects are modelled as coming from a random distribution, whereas fixed effects are not. This is equivalent to the above statement about shrinking effect sizes, because BLUP can be viewed as a Bayesian method which assumes that the SNP effects come from a normal prior distribution with a mean of 0 and a variance that is determined by $h^2$: Low $h^2$ means the prior distribution will have a small variance, so all effects will be shrunk heavily towards 0. A large $h^2$ means that the prior distribution will have a large variance, and so it will be less informative and will have a smaller effect on the posterior distribution of effect sizes (the BLUP estimates), so that the effects will be shrunk less. A fixed effect is thus equivalent to a random effect with a prior distribution that has infinite variance and will not be shrunk at all. Growing sample size will not affect the absolute value of the shrinkage factor $\\lambda$, but it will make it smaller relative to the diagonal elements in $\\textbf{X}^\\top \\textbf{X}$, so the prior distribution will have less effect on the posterior distribution.\n"

With the introduction of SNP genotyping arrays, the model has been adapted so that relationships between cows were not modeled anymore by grouping them into families, but by treating them all as unrelated and calculating their genetic similarity using genome wide SNP data. The pedigree based relatedness matrix has been replaced by the GRM, and the term random effects for breeding values / genetic effects is still used, but the term random effects now only refers to the first definition."

However, the unbiasedness and consistency of OLS estimates depends on [certain assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares#Assumptions), which are not all met in a GWAS setting.

    "Intuitively, this is because GWAS estimates are marginal effect estimates and this means that SNPs in high LD will have similar effect estimates, even if their true effect sizes are very different. A single large effect SNP within a group of correlated SNPs can give each of the correlated SNPs a large effect estimate. If a SNP is in high LD with many other SNPs, its chances of picking up the signal of another SNP are increased.
