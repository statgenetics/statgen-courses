    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past few years, there have been many tools created to run GWAS with increasing number of samples and genetic variants. Aditionally, these softwares use linear mixed models (LMM) to account for population structure, sample relatedness and estimate the genetic architecture of complex traits. BoltLMM, FastGWA and [Regenie](https://rgcgithub.github.io/regenie/) are some of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regenie can perform GWAS's in very large datases such as the UK Biobank.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regenie properties\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Works with quantitative and binary traits (case-control), including those with unbalanced samples case-control ratio. Supports Firth logistic regression and SPA for binary traits.\n",
    "2. Uses linear mixed models (LMM) for quantitative traits and generalized LMM (GLMM) for binary traits, allowing for the inclusion of related individuals. \n",
    "3. Offers the advantage of processing multiple phenotypes at the same time. However you should be aware that quantitave or binary traits need to be analyzed separately. Also, the proportion of missing data should be similar for all of the traits analyzed at once, since it can impact predictions. Authors of regenie recommend to analyze traits in groups that have similar missingness patterns with resonably low amount of missingness (<15%).\n",
    "4. It can handle different types of data (microarray, imputed, exome sequencing) and formats (PLINK:bed/bim/fam, PLINK2:pgen/pvar/psam and BGEN).\n",
    "5. It is desgined to handle a large number of samples ~500K. Regenie is not appropiate to analyze small samples\n",
    "6. Integrates covariates into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Regenie works in two different steps that are independent from each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is where it fits the null regression model, for this regenie uses a subset of genetic markers that capture a good proportion of the phenotype variance that is attributable to genetic effects\n",
    "\n",
    "- Level 0: Ridge regression applied to block of SNPs to reduce dimensions\n",
    "- Level 1: Linear or logistic ridge regressions within cross validation scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "A larger set of genetic markers is used to test for association, using a linear or logistic regression, with the traits conditional upon the prediction from the regression model on step 1. This is done by using the Leave One Chromosome Out (LOCO) scheme to avoid proximal contamination. "
